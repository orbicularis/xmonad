This is a configuration file for xmonad, based largely on the template file available on the xmonad website.  It also includes pieces from the Arch wiki (which has a very helpful set-up page) and also some other bits and pieces I found elsewhere (such as the media keys, which work really well on my Asus ROG laptop).

The xmobarrc config file is a basic configuration with current workspace, internet x-fer speeds, battery, CPU, Memory / Swap, Date, and local temperature.

The Xresources configuration customizes xterm to give it a black background, set the font to SourceCodePro and to let it use the system clipboard via shift-[fn]-insert.
